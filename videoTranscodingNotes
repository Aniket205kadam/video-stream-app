Video Transcoding(Processing)
-> converting video file one format to another format its know as the Transcoding
-> we can convert the quality, resolution, bit rate, etc
-> Conversation is need because we are support all the devices, also in the different resolution

## Key Concepts
Codec: method for encoding or decoding the audio or video
ex-> H.264, H.265

Container: file format that holder .mp4, .avi

Bitrate: amount of data process per second (kbps, mbps)

Resolution: 1920x1080 full Hd

## why transcoding?
1) Compatibility
2) Optimization
3) Adaptive Streaming (1080p, 720p, 360p)

## ffmpeg
-> ffmpeg is library that help to process the data
=> https://www.ffmpeg.org/
=> choco install ffmpeg
use this command to download the ffmpeg

=> see the demo D:\ffmpeg

## HLS -> HTTP Live Streaming Protocol
-> HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is a protocol developed by Apple for streaming media over HTTP. It is widely used for delivering video and audio content over the internet

- **Segmentation:** The video is divided into small segments, typically 2-10 second each.

- **Master Playlist (.m3u8):** Each quality level has its own playlist, listing the URLs of the segments at that quality.
